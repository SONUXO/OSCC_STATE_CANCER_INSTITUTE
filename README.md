# Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma:
This project demonstrates an how to detect OSCC with various CNN model, in addition to that we have proposed a semgentation model which to detect and segment cancerous cell from clinical slides.

## ðŸ“¦ Pipeline Stages (from `dvc.yaml`)

Each stage is modular and reproducible:

1. **Data Ingestion** â€“ Load and split raw data.
2. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Clean and tokenize data.
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Convert text to vectorized format using `TfidfVectorizer`.
4. **Model Building** â€“ Train a classification model.
5. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Evaluate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) and log with MLflow.
6. **Model Registration** â€“ Register the best model version with MLflow.
